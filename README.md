# mort!

Mort is a simple encounter builder for DnD 5e designed on Vue.

The project currently has all the SRD monsters, and calculates the difficulty, as well as the XP for a given encounter to make planning much easier. 

> This project was built mostly as learning experience with the Vue + Vite development frameworks.
